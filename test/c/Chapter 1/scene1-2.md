## Scene 2

An explosion rocks the ship as two robots, Artoo-Detoo (R2-
D2) and See-Threepio (C-3PO) struggle to make their way 
through the shaking, bouncing passageway. Both robots are 
old and battered. Artoo is a short, claw-armed tripod. His 
face is a mass of computer lights surrounding a radar eye. 
Threepio, on the other hand, is a tall, slender robot of 
human proportions. He has a gleaming bronze-like metallic 
surface of an Art Deco design.
