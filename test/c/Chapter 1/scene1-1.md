# Chapter I

## Scene 1

<!-- #tatooine -->
The awesome yellow planet of Tatooine emerges from a total 
eclipse, her two moons glowing against the darkness. A tiny 
silver spacecraft, a Rebel Blockade Runner firing lasers 
from the back of the ship, races through space. It is pursed 
by a giant Imperial Stardestroyer.

<!-- #laserbolts #stardestroyer -->
Hundreds of deadly laserbolts streak from the Imperial Stardestroyer, causing 
the main solar fin of the Rebel craft to disintegrate.
